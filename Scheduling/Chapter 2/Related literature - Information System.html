		According to Aquino <i><u>(2011)</i></u>, Importance of computer application is increasing day by day. In the latest decades of the millennium winning organization are those which are willing to integrate business strategy and computer information technology in plying their respective trades.
		</p>
		<p style="margin:50px;">
The use of computer information technology results for them to be able to develop products fast 
and make decisions fast, ability to have fluid organization structures, able to cope with the 
demanding work force and external environment by the rapid development of innovative 
approaches and lastly using information system confirms the company’s mission vision. The 
school use the information systems in the way of implementing a scheduling system. This results 
for them to search more accurately and easy.
		</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
		We the researchers conduct interview to different personnel in the school who’s in 
charge of the scheduling process specifically the registrar personnel. Different 
scheduling system studies from other schools were also studied to gather more data 
and as referenced in building the system. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
		Upon careful analysis of the different data, 
we formulated a quick design in a form of prototypes then have it presented to the 
personnel that are connected to class scheduling. Prototyping Cycles. Series of 
prototypes were presented to the scheduling personnel and registrar to examine 
and approve the proposed design. These parts consist of demonstrate, refine and 
develop that take several loops until the prototype has been approved.
</p>
<p style="margin:50px;">
		Testing. 
Testing of the system was conducted only by the researchers in the design process. 
Since the time allotted in not sufficient enough, not all the phases were used. The 
testing phase is very short and the deployment phase was skipped. In using the 
prototyping model, the proponents made use of HTML, PHP, Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS), and MySQL database. These programming language, scripts and database are 
suitable in this project making the development process faster and easier. Data 
Gathering Tools Considering that the Registrar, Planning and Extension Officer, and 
the Deans as the vital sources of data and information for this study. Other sources 
of data or information include books, published and unpublished researches or 
studies conducted, articles or journal published in the internet and the NPCMSTI 
school policy handbook or manual. Data Gathering Techniques The following data 
gathering techniques were used in the study as they are beneficial enough in 
building the system. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	The proponents interviewed all the persons involved in making 
the class schedule of subjects. Problems encountered and different suggestions 
gathered were carefully analyzed to improve the class scheduling system. 
Observation. Other schools have been using semi-automated class scheduling 
system already. The researchers went to different schools to observe the flow of their 
class scheduling as they prepare for their enrollment.
Research and Document analysis. The proponents gathered data from different books, magazines, published and unpublished materials regarding scheduling 
system in different libraries. Data gathered were carefully compared and examined 
to identify its efficiency in the enrollment process. Requirements Management The 
system requirements by the users and personnel involved in class scheduling must 
be monitored using progress reports and the changes of their project requirements. 
It also includes the process of determining and ensuring the effects of the 
specifications and diversity on product scope and quality. Allocation and property of 
risk factors were also noted. In the disposition of management processes, precise 
changes were done in the performance of the formations and the use of change of 
control panel. Schedule Control The proponents spent their free time building the 
project before the deadline. The proponents also spent a lot of effort to achieve their 
goal but it all depends on the allotted schedule. The proponents mostly focus their 
time building the system to be successful.
