			Based on the researcher <i><u>(2011)</i></u>, a web based-schedule viewing system for VERITAS 
Parochial School (VPS) in Manila was developed to help its students search in a more efficient 
way without hassles. It is with the web-based viewing schedule system for VPS that this style of 
searching may be achieved. 
		</p>
		<p style="margin:50px;">
			 This new type of system offers its students new option for searching 
at VPS. By logging on to VPS website. One can register and search the information of the faculty for a school year. With these the student has the right to view his/her room, subject and instructor, 
because the user created an account via registration. Only the school-admin can create their student 
account, the registration of accounts is only created inside the school.

Scheduler System is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines,
techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preï¿¾existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input or output relation or perform a 
specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including, machinery, modifications,
arrangements, and procedures (Williams, 2012). One of the remarkable and much known products of 
technology advancement is the conversion of manually-operated system into automated system. 
Automation produces a great impact in the lives of man, particularly in the field of industry, business, 
medicine, and education (Williams, 2012). A scheduling system is usually a form of software that allows 
someone to construct schedules in an easier, faster and error minimized way. It is very time consuming 
and sometimes leads to a disaster if output is not efficient.
