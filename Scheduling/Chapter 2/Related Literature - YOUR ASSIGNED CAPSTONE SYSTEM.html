		<b>Scheduling of classes</b> has been one of the most important factors that schools need to 
prepare before enrolment plays an important role in providing an idea of the students in managing 
their time. Scheduling, on the other hand, was defined as logical sequencing of activities which 
include its durations. <i><u>(Yang 2007)</i></u>

			 <b>Scheduling System</b> is a powerful tool designed to help create school’s master schedule. 
The schedule created by the scheduling system can be analyzed, adjusted and rerun an unlimited 
number of times until the desired results are achieved. The power of Scheduling system will greatly 
reduce the time it takes to create school’s faculty schedules. <i><u>(Gordon Smith, 2007)</i></u>

		This 
study is intended to design and develop a Class Scheduling System of Mandaue City 
College. It sought to find answers to the following specific problems: What is the 
existing procedure in the current Class Scheduling System of Mandaue City College? 
What are the problems encountered in the existing Class Scheduling System of 
Mandaue City College? What are the factors that affect the performance of the 
Mandaue City College Class Scheduling system in terms of: Speed, Accuracy, 
Security and Data Handling?
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
		<b>Class Scheduling System</b> was designed and created 
using the PHP programming language. On this web-based module, it allows 
transactional operations such as database access and interactive web interface. 
MySQL 5.0 was used as back-end of the proposed Class Scheduling System because 
it is one of the most popular Database Management Tools that can handle billions of 
records in a most complicated transactional database operation of many business 
organizations. Factors that Affect the Performance of the System Speed. Speed 
refers to the capability of the system to handle data in time that the user is satisfied.

	Many things must be considered in order to make the system execute faster. As 
records increases in the database, the performance of the computer decreases. In 
order to solve this problem, database backup must be done weekly and database 
cleaning to remove unnecessary records. Previous schedule is not needed anymore 
so it must be deleted. In terms of hardware, using the required computer hardware 
is necessary. Server computer must me used and clients must be the latest personal 
computer available in the market. Upgrading can be done every five years to level up 
with the increasing number of records. Accuracy. Accuracy refers to the capability of 
the system to produce desired output.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	In order to do this in class scheduling system, 
data formatting is needed. Data format sets guidelines for users to enter correct 
input. Time format must be followed in the system to avoid errors and for the 
accuracy of the system. The system has been tested and presented to the registrar.
