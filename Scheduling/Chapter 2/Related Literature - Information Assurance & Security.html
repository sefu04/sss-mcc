		<p style="margin:50px;">
		Based on Harvent School <i><u>(2011)</i></u>, Harvent School in Dagupan City, composed of 
elementary and High school level. The school puts premium top system. The Scheduling process 
is the initial stage in gathering bon fide accurate student information necessary to establish student 
permanent records. The system provides the access to the students to see their school records such 
as students’ personal information and grades.
		</p>
		<p style="margin:50px;">
The system will work only in their facility; the school 
principal serves as the admin and the school also provides their top security system to avoid 
information leakage.</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	The records in database are maintained by saving all the important records 
only. The proposed system needs to store great numbers of data, it is utmost 
important to have a backup and have secondary storage of data and reports for back 
up purpose and safety of records in case of corruption of data happened. Data will 
be ensured to be kept safe from corruption and to help ensure privacy.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	Personnel 
risk. The system administrator will train a hired person 2 to 3 days to familiarize the 
flow of the system. If this hired person will resign, they will find first a replacement 
before he/she will permanently resign. The user of the system does not necessarily 
need to be a technical expert but must have academic experience about computer. 
It is a necessity to have an average functional literacy and most importantly the user 
should be dedicated to learn how to use the system. Technology risk. The 
proponents will continue to update the system and adding features, regarding on 
upcoming new version of XAMPP. The proponents require replacing the existing 
system and adopting the new version.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	The proponents need to adjust for the 
upcoming software. Process risk. The system might hang if the user doesn’t know 
what the process. The proponents provide a user manual to help them how to use 
the system. The plan of this proposed system is to have an easy way in evaluating 
the professors of the school.
