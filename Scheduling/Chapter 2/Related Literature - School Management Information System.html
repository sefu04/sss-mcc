	<h1>
		Related Literature - School Management Information System
	</h1>

		<p style="margin:50px;">Based on Southern California Community College <i><u>(2012)</i></u>, the Southern California 
Community College Long Beach City College has gone live with a Cognos-Based faculty and 
student scheduling management system that was designed by Irvine, CA-base professional 
services firm e2e Analytics. Prior to installing the new system. LBCC, which has two main 
campuses and multiple satellites that support nine schools and 34 departments.
		</p>
		<p style="margin:50px;">
		The school’s <b>scheduling management system</b> budgeting and planning up to three months to compile, 
consolidate, and implement. Updating and checking of faculty and students Information was 
inspired by the advancement of modern technology. The researchers gathered data necessary in 
the scheduling system for the success of the study providing benefit of the employees and students 
so they can have access and have access and have the ability to manage information directly and 
conveniently.
		</p>
<p style="margin:50px;">
		The proposed system is expected to work properly. The proponents 
will make sure that there is no error and the system is 100% working. Specifying 
quality control activities by knowing the procedures in using the following purposes: 
To be able to good stewardship of our valuable institutional resources. Know the 
knowledge, skills and experience of the person; To be able to verify if the system is 
working properly; and to be able to check the system before it will be deployed in 
school. Reporting The descriptions which will be used to display the result of the 
research and inquiry will be provided together with the project's formal 
documentation. Records that are written in the documentation will be comprised of 
a recognized output and conclusion. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
		Significant report will also give the proponents 
an idea about the flow of the system. The proponents will specify status of each task 
for the development of the project management. Analyzing the needed progress for 
the system is required in order to accomplish a sufficient report. Risk Management 
Plan The proponents knew that there are some factors that might affect the 
proposed system and they understood the collision this may cause. The proponents
included in their project schedule, a time to develop an alternative solution if 
unwanted problems occur. The proponents gathered lots of information to work on 
the proposed system properly. Loosely defined requirements, difficulties in 
estimating the time and resources required for the software development, type of 
individual skills can be encountered during the project schedule. The quality of the 
software being developed by the group, can only assure that the research 
proponents all equipped with information and solutions. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	<b>The following risks in 
developing the proposed system are: </b>
</p>
<p style="margin:50px;">
	Database risk The records will be saved in the 
database, but after a year, unused records must be deleted to prevent database 
collapse. The records in database are maintained by saving all the important records 
only. The proposed system needs to store great numbers of data, it is utmost 
important to have a backup and have secondary storage of data and reports for back 
up purpose and safety of records in case of corruption of data happened. Data will 
be ensured to be kept safe from corruption and to help ensure privacy
</p>
<p style="margin:50px;">
	Personnel 
risk. The system administrator will train a hired person 2 to 3 days to familiarize the 
flow of the system. If this hired person will resign, they will find first a replacement 
before he/she will permanently resign. The user of the system does not necessarily 
need to be a technical expert but must have academic experience about computer. 
It is a necessity to have an average functional literacy and most importantly the user 
should be dedicated to learn how to use the system. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	Technology risk. The 
proponents will continue to update the system and adding features, regarding on 
upcoming new version of XAMPP. The proponents require replacing the existing 
system and adopting the new version. The proponents need to adjust for the 
upcoming software
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	Process risk. The system might hang if the user doesn’t know 
what the process. The proponents provide a user manual to help them how to use 
the system. The plan of this proposed system is to have an easy way in evaluating 
the professors of the school. Project Closeout Plan The proponents will do their best 
to finish the system
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	They learned that it takes months to create a system and 
difficulties are expected to arise. It is expected that system will benefit both the 
students and the school if the proposed Class Scheduling System successfully 
applied. This chapter discusses the procedures of the existing class scheduling 
system. It also presents the proposed computerized class scheduling system. The 
 Procedure and Problems The existing Class Scheduling System has 
been functioning in a semi-computerized process. The preparation starts six months 
prior to the start of enrollment. In the initial stage of preparation, the Registrar’s 
Office provides the initial input for the Planning and Extension Office and for the HR 
Department when necessary. These inputs are the subject offerings for the coming 
semester.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	Other inputs would come from the Heads on the different departments. 
Only the Deans or heads the different departments know the specific subjects with
laboratory attachments, actual number of students within the department, the 
number and availability of laboratory rooms to be used in the coming semesters, 
and the availability of faculty members qualified to teach on the available subjects.
Upon plotting the schedules for general education, the planning office integrates 
the schedules plotted by department heads with the corresponding faculty 
members assigned on every subject. After the integration, the registrar collects all 
the data for initial review and checking for conflicting assignments which is more 
common for the higher years due to students with irregular schedules
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	 These 
students do not belong to any block section. Most irregular students who enrolled 
advance subjects and others might as well be taking these subjects the next 
semester. After the schedules are thoroughly checked for errors, the plotted schedules would be submitted to the VPAA for rechecking and approval. After it was 
approved, the plotted schedules will now be posted on all bulletin boards within the 
campus. In the meantime, plotting forms are prepared for students and faculty 
members to use during the enrollment. The widest downside of the manual 
scheduling approach is that the scheduler cannot look at every combination of 
schedules and evaluate which one is the best. Since the scheduler cannot look at 
every combination, it is likely that an overlap in courses is necessary in order to 
schedule all the courses into the timetable. Some quarters might work out with 
minimal overlap at the class level; however other quarters would result in overlaps in 
critical courses.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	These overlaps affect the student’s ability to take their desired 
courses. Proposed Computerized Class Scheduling System Through the proposed 
computerized class scheduling system, the class scheduling would be easily 
managed and records would be easily tracked, processed and stored, because the 
proposed system will provide a module for the Planning and Extension Office (PEO) 
and the Registrars ‘Office that allows the personnel in-charge to generate or create a 
report or even make the necessary adjustments on specific records in real time. For 
the students, the proposed Class Scheduling System would provide an easy request 
for an updated class schedule where he/ she is enrolled. This would be possible, for 
the proposed system allows other departments, such as the office of the Deans and 
Department Head, to have an access with the system so that they could generate a 
copy of the student’s class schedule from the server. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	 Using any web browser 
installed in the computer, personnel can view their student’s information in web 
base format. The proposed Class Scheduling System was designed and created 
using the PHP programming language. On this web-based module, it allows 
transactional operations such as database access and interactive web interface. 
MySQL 5.0 was used as back-end of the proposed Class Scheduling System because 
it is one of the most popular Database Management Tools that can handle billions of 
records in a most complicated transactional database operation of many business 
organizations. Factors that Affect the Performance of the System Speed. Speed 
refers to the capability of the system to handle data in time that the user is satisfied. 
Many things must be considered in order to make the system execute faster. As 
records increases in the database, the performance of the computer decreases. In 
order to solve this problem, database backup must be done weekly and database 
cleaning to remove unnecessary records. Previous schedule is not needed anymore 
so it must be deleted. In terms of hardware, using the required computer hardware 
is necessary. Server computer must me used and clients must be the latest personal 
computer available in the market. Upgrading can be done every five years to level up 
with the increasing number of records. Accuracy. Accuracy refers to the capability of 
the system to produce desired output.
</p>
<p style="margin:50px;">
	In order to do this in class scheduling system, 
data formatting is needed. Data format sets guidelines for users to enter correct 
input. Time format must be followed in the system to avoid errors and for the 
accuracy of the system.
