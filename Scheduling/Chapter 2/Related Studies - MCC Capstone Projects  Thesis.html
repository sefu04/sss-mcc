Findings MCC uses the manual way of making class 
schedule.
</p>


<p style="margin:50px;">
First, the registrar gets the previous schedule for revision. They revised it 
believing that, this is the fastest way of making a schedule. Adding schedules of 
another section is what they are doing. One error can lead to lot of problems if not 
seen by the registrar. Class schedule usually took two to three weeks to make the 
temporary schedule. The class schedule done is still temporary since alterations is 
done during and after enrollment. This is due to inefficient scheduling. Rooms and 
instructors are changed due to conflicts and unavailability of instructors. Sometimes 
it is due to conflict in schedule itself that is not seen before the enrollment.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
	Human 
error contributes a lot in this error. Rooms are not also used efficiently due to wrong scheduling. Rooms are not fully occupied during the day leaving spaces that no one 
uses it. The following are the factors that affect the performance of the system that 
can lead to system error if not considered significantly. In terms of speed, the system 
is programed in a web-based form to increases the speed of transactions. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
Network 
configurations are managed by the operating system and not by the system. User 
training must also be conducted to familiarize user about how to use properly the 
system. In terms of accuracy, the system uses time format to ensure the correctness 
of output. In terms of security, the first page that will appear in the system is the 
login page.
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
Username and password must be provided to access the content of the 
system. Two power users are presented to the system in order to restrict and divide 
functionalities. The administrator controls user accounts. In case the registrar forgets 
his/her username and password, the administrator can retrieve and show it. A 
hidden and fixed emergency username and password can show the username and
password of the administrator in case the he/ she forget it. PHP programming was 
also used in the system thus hiding codes if anyone wants to view the source code. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
In terms of data handling, records have been accessed using Standard Query 
Language (SQL). This is the fastest and most efficient way of data handling. With the 
use of PHP programming, data are also executed the fastest way. Conclusions The 
manual system is surely a traditional way of making schedules. However, the 
automated class scheduling system is more efficient because of the distinctive 
performance in the aspect of speed, project design, accuracy and stability of the 
system in the preparation of class schedules, room schedules and instructors’ load. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
With these features, the automated system can really solve the primary problems 
being encountered during the class schedule preparation. The instructors who
handling specific subjects on certain rooms are listed. One cannot create edit, 
update the schedule except for the one in charge to make the schedule. This
schedule is based on the instructions in the sections. The room schedules are
automatically created with the section and instructor’s schedule.
