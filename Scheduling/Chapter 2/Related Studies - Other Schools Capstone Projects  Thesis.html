	Northern Philippines College for Maritime 
Science and Technology (NPCMST) as an educational institution offers services to the clientele more 
particularly the students and to the community. The primary operations of the school are non-stop 
starting from pre-enrolment up to the post-graduation activities. These activities require money, labor 
force and time. It is a fact that arranging class schedules, instructor’s load and room utilization for the 
students and faculty in every department is one of the many activities that each department heads must 
prepare before classes start. 
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
But the school used the manual way of preparing the class schedule. With 
the manual system, more time and labor force are required to plot, arrange, and revise the class 
schedules, room utilization and instructors’ load provided by the department heads. This process is a 
very large, complex, and time-consuming task with many inputs to take into consideration. The quality 
of the output has an immense impact on students, faculty, and the department as a whole.  
</p>

<p style="margin:50px;">
 Poorly 
planned offerings pose a great impact on students’ ability to take courses, class utilization, and students’ 
ability to fulfill prerequisites, time to graduation, budget, and more. Poorly assigned faculty has a big 
impact to the quality of instruction, the satisfaction of faculty members, student retention, and 
department policies. Poorly scheduled timetable can also affect students’ ability to take courses due to 
conflict, course utilization, lab utilization, time to graduation, student satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, 
department policies, and it can lead to undesirable last-minute changes.
