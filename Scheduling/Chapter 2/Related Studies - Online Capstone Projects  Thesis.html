			According to <i>Dr. Dibon</i> <i><u>(2010)</i></u>, a study on a report on the Impact of Workload on Teachers 
and Student’s stated that Teacher’s expressed concern that higher level of frustration and stress 
due to a lack of assigned time to prepare classes can negatively impact on their interactions with 
students. The lack of preparation time can also result in classes that are not planned/prepared as 
well as they could be.
		</p>
		<p style="margin:50px;">
			Further, when a teacher doesn’t have time to properly assess student work, 
in a timely fashion, and has little time to provide tutorial classes, remedial work for students who 
need extra help is often compromised. Having adequate preparation time is a critical factor to a 
teacher satisfaction.

This study is proposed with the 
aforementioned reasons as stated. This process partially defines the lives of students and faculty 
members in terms of schedule and should not be taken lightly. Because of the impact of this process, it 
is important to incorporate individual and group preference into as many areas of this process as 
possible and to create a robust process that generates close to optimal solutions. There has been 
research around course assignment and course timetabling and many operations research techniques 
have been utilized to address these problems, however often the techniques are tested, but rarely 
implemented as shown by Carterand Lamporte (1998). While some solutions have been fully 
implemented and there are a couple products available in the market, those weren’t thoroughly 
investigated due to the software and implementation cost associated with them.
