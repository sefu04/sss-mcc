<p>
Before diving into the project, I would like to acknowledge the people that were a great help throughout 
with our journey with this Capstone Project Scheduling System of Mandaue City College. I would like to 
acknowledge and give my warmest thanks to my Instructor Mr. Ramces Dungog who made this work 
possible.

throughout the development of this Capstone Project is the one who gave us the idea, can also help to
expand our knowledge.

Additionally, I would like to give credits to all my members for helping and being 
so attentive and cooperative to get started with these project process. Thank you for the hard work of

Finally, I would like to Thank God for guiding as despite of the difficulties weâ€™ve encounter every stage of
