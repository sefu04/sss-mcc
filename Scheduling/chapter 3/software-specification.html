            Front End</p>
        <h3>Fron End</h3>
        <p>The proponents use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery as its client-side or front-end of the proposed system. HTML is the markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser and CSS is used for describing the presentation of a document that is written in HTML format. JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. It was developed as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. Bootstrap also contains CSS-based and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface. JQueryâ€™s purpose is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on the website. The proponents also use ASP.NET CORE as its web technology, it is  a modular framework that runs on both the full .NET Framework on windows, and the cross- platform.</p>
    <h3>Back End</h3>
    <p>The proponents use C#.NET, MSSQL database, Internet Information Services(IIS) as its server-side or back-end of the proposed system. C#.NET enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. MSSQL database, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications which may run on the same computer or another computer across network. Internet Information Servieces(IIS) is used to host ASP.NET web application.</p>
