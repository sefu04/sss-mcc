		SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
	</h1>
		
		<p>
			The purpose of the system was to create a more accurate and effective way for scheduling. It would be most beneficial to the following:
Department Head. The proposed system will benefit the department chairman in creating an accurate scheduling option that will let her/him build course schedule.

		</p>
			Instructors. Instructors can start classes on time without experiencing conflicts as to schedule and room assignments.
Students. The proposed system will help students determine their class schedule before the start of the semester.

		<p>
			Future Researchers. This study will encourage future researchers to conduct similar study on a wider scope, this research will also provide relevant information that will help them to develop a system that is similar with the said system. It will be an opportunity for the next batch of researchers to review the project and apply the necessary changes and updates.
