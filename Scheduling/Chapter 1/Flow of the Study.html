			<b>Input </b>
		</p>
		<p>
		The researchers  observed  the  existing  problem  of  the  school  regarding  the  manual scheduling and conduct interview in gathering data. The gathered data will be served as input to the flow of the study.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Process </b>
		</p>
		<p>
		The  researchers  used  the  waterfall  model.  The  researchers  conduct  a  meeting  for  the  proposed system. After this, they conducted an interview from Mandaue City College for the further details of  the  proposed  system.  They  gathered  more  information  to  complement  the  documents  of  the system. 

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Output </b>
		</p>
		<p>
		After  gathering  of  data,  the  researchers  analyze  the  gathered  data  and  proposed  a  scheduling system that could help the department to manage student’s information and to provide them a more accurate and efficient way of scheduling.
