		Rationale of The Study
	</h1>
		
		<p>
		Class scheduling of colleges and universities is one of a large, hard and time-consuming tasks. Along the time line of each classroom slots must be able to be allocated to instructors and their classes of different departments. (Hinkin and Thompson 2022) states that, course scheduling is defined as the assignment of a set of courses to different time slots and classrooms while satisfying certain requirements. Class scheduling refers to the process of preparing a class schedule. It shows subject, time allotment, days, and room utilization. Both instructor and student use it for reference as classes begin. Scheduling of classes has been one of the most important factors that school needs to prepare before enrolment plays on important role in providing an idea of the students in managing their time.

		It is said that, class schedules are planned for smooth operation. However, In Mandaue City College, the current scheduling management are being done manually. They process the schedules of students and faculties manually such as plotting of subjects, faculty load and room utilization. They usually encounter problems to. The start of classes every semester is sometimes delayed due to late posting of class schedule because of some conflicts of the schedules. This problem is always encountered by the department, students and instructors.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The proponents plan to propose an IT Capstone which is the class scheduling for Mandaue City College. The study is conducted to identify possible solutions to the problems met
 
by the instructors, class advisers, students, department chair, and of the school as a whole. The propose system will solve the existing problem encountered in manual scheduling used by Mandaue City College.
